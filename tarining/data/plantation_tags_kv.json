{"content": "The following key assumptions were made in arriving at the above ﬁgure. According to the actuarial valuation report issued by the actuarial valuer as at 31 March 2018 the actuarial present value of promised, retirement beneﬁts amounted to Rs. 886,008,628/- (2016/17 - Rs. 791,914,041/-).
